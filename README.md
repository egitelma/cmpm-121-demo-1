This is the starter code project for the `Demo 1` project in CMPM 121, Game Design Patterns, at UC Santa Cruz (fall quarter, 2024). Students should incrementally modify this project, tracking their progress wit git, to develop an incremental game of their own unique design.

- Inspiration was taken from this other Demo 1 project for the box shadow/button animation: https://elin38.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/
- Inspiration was taken from this other Demo 1 project for the sidebar organization from this project: https://actiasanii.github.io/cmpm-121-demo-1/
I encourage you reading this to check both these projects out! They're very nicely organized.
